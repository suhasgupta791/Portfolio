# Assignment 2: Word Embeddings and ML Fairness

This assignment consists of two notebooks:
* [Word Embeddings](Embeddings.ipynb)
* [ML Fairness](MLFairness.ipynb), in which you'll explore the ways things can go horribly (and subtly!) wrong
* [TensorFlow](TensorFlow.ipynb), in which we'll train our first deep neural network.
* [answers](answers) file where you'll put all your answers

This assignment builds on the [embeddings.ipynb](../../materials/embeddings/embeddings.ipynb) demo notebook, so you may want to review it before you start.

## Submission Instructions

As with Assignment 1, please submit by running the submit script, only with `-a 2` (since this is assignment 2).
```
./assignment/submit.sh -u your-github-username -a 2
```

It is your responsibility to check that your work has made it to your GitHub repository in the `a2-submit` branch.  As always, a small number of points will be given in each assignment for submitting in the right place.
