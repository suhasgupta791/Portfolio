# Assignment 4: Machine Translation Q&A

This assignment is a short treatment of the material over the last several weeks:  machine translation, transformers, and summarization.  It's intentionally lightweight so that you can spend your time focused on your project.

## Submission Instructions

As with Assignment 1, please submit by running the submit script, only with `-a 4` (since this is assignment 4).
```
./assignment/submit.sh -u your-github-username -a 4
```

It is your responsibility to check that your work has made it to your GitHub repository in the `a4-submit` branch.  As always, a small number of points will be given in each assignment for submitting in the right place.
