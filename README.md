# Suhas Gupta Portfolio

**(www.linkedin.com/in/guptasuhas)**

#### Lead electrical engineer at Apple Inc. designing state of the art hardware for Macbook Pros. 
  - Successfully launched multiple Macbook Pro products to mass production including Apple's first 16 inch Macbook Pro in 2019 as the lead electrical engineer for display module. 
  - Led electrical system and silicon architecture design, implmented schematics and layout, supervised lab and factory validation and assembly process as the display electrical module lead. 
  - Efficiently managed design and operations of failure analysis and directed engineering personnel to meet tight project deadlines and successfully deliver products to market.
  - Lead cross-functional effort to automate image analysis for display defect detection through
computer vision and machine learning algorithm development. This effort is intended to improve the display product development efficiency by 5x through elimination of qualitative binning of display performance by human operators. Proficient in developing code in a team environment
using Git.
  - Developed a portable automation library for data processing and analysis in MATLAB and Python
that improved electrical module validation efficiency by 3x.

#### Design Engineer and Semiconductor Technologist @ Intel Corporation (previous)
  - Led design of semiconductor devices and circuits for mixed signal IP development delivering three novel process nodes and enabled 2x manufacturing cost scaling per year.
  - Drove technology definition through complex wafer data analysis consisting of defect signatures from more than a billion on-chip transistors and interconnect segments.
  - Developed innovative circuit using gradient descent regression analysis to enable 20% silicon area scaling in 3D multi CPU chip architectures.
