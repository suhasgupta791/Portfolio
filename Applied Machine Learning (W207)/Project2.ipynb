    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

It has positive weight for both 'alt.atheism' and 'talk.religion.misc' news sub groups. the weights for this feature for the two categories are also close to each other in value. Logistic regression seems to determine that this feature differentiates the two categories from the rest. Our logistic regression is also unable to differentiate between these two categories based on the 'cheers kent' bigram feature. We can see this matches the categories output in the last code segment that have this feature.**"

    "(5) Try to improve the logistic regression classifier by passing a custom preprocessor to CountVectorizer. The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular. With your new preprocessor, how much did you reduce the size of the dictionary?\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",

    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TF-IDF is the abbreviation for term frequency–inverse document frequency. It is intended to give the importance of a work for a document and serves as a weighting factor in text feature creation. The TF-IDF increases propotionally as the number of times a word appears in a text and gets offset by the number of document in the data set that contain that word. Thus, it adjusts for the fact that some words appear more frequently than others in general.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Two of the three largest R-ratios are associated with those topics that acutally belong to religion category but predicted to be in conputer graphics category. This could be due to the fact that these text included technical words like ASCII, Latex, RTF, internet, online etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. In general, we can see from the confusion matrix, that the most confused categories are **alt.atheism** and **talk.religion.misc**(44.8%). This can be expected from the nature of the text present in the two categories.\n",
    "The misclassification between **comp.graphics** and **talk.religion.misc** is relatively small even though the two highest R ratios are found for these two misclassified categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Looking at the statistics for the R ratio, we see that when we group by true labels in the dev dataset, the categories atheism and religion have the higher R ratio mean and standard deviation. However, when we group the R ratio statistics by the predicted labels, computer graphics category has the maximum R ratio mean and std. deviation. This suggests that when the true label is computer graphics, our model makes the right prediction most of the time. However, the model predicts computer graphics on most occasions when the true label is something else. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. This problem may be fixed by removing some of the non selective features from the model. e.g. if features that predict computer graphics are also common to other categories then we can remove them from the model and this may reduce the misclassification of the labels. "
